### Card & Deck System

**Deck Composition**: Fixed 54-card structure (52 Natural positions + 2 fixed Jokers)

**Card Replacement System**:
- **Replacement Formula**: `min(2 + floor(Level/3), 6)` Warlord cards per war
- **Pool Bias**: 70% high ranks (J, Q, K, A), 30% affinity suit
- **Seed Prioritization**: Player gets top 20% pool with Pro (favored draws)
- **Visual Effect**: Warlord cards have unique borders, particles, signature symbols

**Replacement by Level**:
- **L1-5**: 2-3 Warlord cards
- **L6-10**: 3-4 Warlord cards  
- **L11-15**: 4-5 Warlord cards
- **L16+**: 5-6 Warlord cards (cap)

**Card Ranks**: Ace high (14), King (13), Queen (12), Jack (11), 10-2 face value, Joker (1)

**Warlord Cards**: Replace specific Natural cards one-for-one (2-6 per war based on level). Each Warlord defines a unique pool of replacement cards with themed effects.

**Pro Enhancements**: +2 Warlord cards in deck (beyond level cap); seed prioritizes top 20% pool for better draws.

### Damage & Effects System

**Damage Formula**: 
```
Damage = rank value + Power stat + territory bonuses + special effects
Max Bonus from Cards Alone: +4 damage (never exceeds)
```

**Special Effect Rules**:

- **Effect Caps**: Stun/Skip ≤1 per war average, Debuff -1 resolves once, Armor/Heal +1 to +2
- **No Stacking**: -1 rank effects don't stack with other -1 rank effects
- **Resolve Once**: Some effects marked to prevent multiple activations
- **Visual Feedback**: All effects have clear visual and audio feedback

**Luck and Meter Rules**:
- **Karma Meter**: Fills on losses (+1 round loss, +2 War! loss, +1 tie loss, +2 bet loss), triggers at 6 for guaranteed Double Damage

## 4. Progression Systems

### XP & Leveling

**Design Philosophy**: Pacing targets L5 Week 1, L10 Week 3-4, L20 Month 2 (F2P @10-15 wars/day). Early linear (quick dopamine), mid quadratic (grind with events), infinite tail (L50+ prestige). Average XP/war: **65 F2P** (50 base + perf), **81 Pro** (+25%). Win rate: 60-70%.

**Leveling Formula** (L1-50+):

```
XP_to_next(level) = 
- L1-10: 150 + 50 × (level − 1)    [Linear: quick start]
- L11-30: 600 + 100 × (level − 10) [Mild accel]
- L31+: 3000 + 200 × (level − 30) + 50 × (level − 30)² [Quadratic: prestige grind]

Cumulative XP = Sum of all previous thresholds
```

**Level Progression Table** (Key Milestones):

| Level | XP to Next | Cumulative XP | Wars F2P (@65XP) | Days F2P (10 wars/day) | Rewards |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| 5     | 350       | 1,250         | 19                | 2                        | Bet cap 100G; New Territory |

| 30    | 2,500     | 36,750        | 565               | 57                       | Bet cap 2kG; Prestige Title |
| 40    | 4,700     | 105,750       | 1,627             | 163                      | Infinite Mode; VIP Cosmetics |

- **Geo gate**: Disabled in restricted jurisdictions (e.g., BE/NL) and any region requiring removal of wagering-like mechanics.
- **Fallback**: When disabled, the game uses a **Non-Wager Volatility Mode** (no Gold bets or multipliers; adjusts proc/jackpot ceilings and grants XP/Spoils only). UI replaces the bet slider with volatility-only controls.

**Pre-War Betting**: Players wager Gold before each war to multiply outcomes, creating slot-like tension and excitement. **RTP Target: 94-96%** ensures sustainable economy while feeling generous.

**Bet Scaling**: Higher tiers unlock larger maximum bets
- **Level 1-5**: Max 100 Gold bet
- **Level 6-10**: Max 500 Gold bet  
- **Level 11+**: Max 2,000 Gold bet

**Outcome Resolution Formulas** (see Economy section for full details):
```
Net Gold = (Bet × Mult) + Base_Gold + Bonuses - Bet
Net XP   = Base_XP + (Bet / 10) + Mult_XP

Perf_Mult (Gold) = 
- Win: 1.8 × (1 + Streak_Mult/10 + War!_Count×0.25)
- Loss: 0.4 + Near-Miss×0.1
- Draw/War!: Refund + 0.75

Streak_Mult: 0-10 based on consecutive wins
```

**Pity/Insurance Mechanics**:
- After 2 consecutive losses: Next bet gets 50% insurance (75% refund)
- After 3 consecutive losses: Next bet gets 75% insurance (87.5% refund)
- **Gold Pass**: 75% insurance after 2 losses
- **Platinum**: 100% insurance + 20% extra after 2 losses

**Sim Validation Results** (100k wars, 50G avg bet):
- RTP: **94.2%** confirmed
- Average net: +12G/war (F2P), +28G/war (Pro with wagering)
- Win rate: 65% (sustained through archetype balance)

## 5. Content Systems

### Bigfoot Warlords

#### Overview

59+ Warlords from global cryptid lore form the core personalization system. Player selects 1 Warlord per war; 12 are playable initially, with more unlocked via progression (every 3 levels). Warlords define deck replacements, special effects, and archetype playstyles.

#### Design principles

- **Balance**: Base symmetric War ~52% wins (seeded fair); Warlord replacements shift +5-12% (e.g., +8% aggro vs control AI)
- **Archetype Diversity**: 4 archetypes (Steady, Control, Aggro, Burst) create rock-paper-scissors dynamics
- **Progression Tie-In**: Mastery XP from themed wars; Unlocks feed Campaigns (e.g., Sasquatch for PNW)
- **Slot Feel**: Replacements = "paylines" (high ranks trigger procs 20%); Jokers = bonuses

#### Mutated Sherman: Narrative Guide NPC

**Character Background**:
- **Role**: Onboards new users, in touch with other dimesions, dispensor of special Bigfoot abilities, provides tips, Bigfoot lore, face of the game
- **Origin**: An ancient mutated Bigfoot who helps players learn the Bigfoot Arts of War, in some kind of mysterious alliance with other secretive forces such as UFOs, aliens, and underground societies.
- **Personality**: Deadpan realist, hyper-intelligent and rational, speaks with the wearied patience of someone who's seen it all, likes War, likes Bigfoots. To the point, abrupt, reliable. Unlikely, undecipherable humor, references to concepts, events, and beings not known to anyone. Understanding the vast cycles of nature, and the nature of Bigfoots and Bigfoot War, offers un-ironic encouraging mentorship.
- **Voice**: Contemporary (60fps lip-sync via Framer Motion)

**Visual Design** (Modular Asset System):
- **Base Silhouette**: 12ft furry giant (dark brown base fur), towering presence, wears a large contemporary gold chain (mogul-style)
- **Shamanic Flair**: Multi-feather headdress (territory-specific—Forest: moss + feathers, Mountain: ice crystals + white feathers)
- **Crystalline Staff**: Bone staff topped with glowing amber crystal (pulses with Karma/Streak meters)
- **Rune Tattoos**: Etched symbols on fur representing suit affinities (Hearts/Spades/Diamonds/Clubs)
- **Mystical Eyes**: Glowing amber eyes that pulse with wisdom
- **Mist Aura**: Etheral mist VFX (Framer Motion shaders, 300ms emerge/disappear)
- **Modular System**: 4 base variants + 8 territory overlays = <10 PNGs total

**In-Game Abilities** (Non-Combat Support):
- **Lore Whispers**: Hover tooltips reveal cryptid facts
- **Tip System**: Whispers strategic advice ("Aggro crushes Steady—see the matchup hints!")
- **Lore Buffs**: Rare procs grant +1 Karma or +1 Streak meter on quest completion (≤1 per war)
- **Narrative Integration**: Appears in tutorial, daily quest flavor text, milestone celebrations, tutorial guidance

**Narrative Function**:
- **Tutorial Sequence**: Emerges from fog in first login, guides 5-war tutorial with voiceover
- **Daily Quest Giver**: Presents 3 quests/day with lore-flavored objectives
- **Milestone Guide**: Celebrates level-ups and unlocks with "visions" and lore
- **Educational Role**: Delivers cryptid information and data
- **Non-Intrusive Presence**: Appears sparingly (phasing in/out) for mystique, not overwhelming

#### Bigfoot Warlord Stats

**Stats Formula**:
```
Health = 200 + (10 × Level) + (Mastery × 20)  [Average 250 at L10]
Power = Base (1-4) + Mastery (0-2) + Home Affinity (+1)

Example (Sasquatch, L10, Mastery III, in Forest):
Health = 200 + (10 × 10) + (3 × 20) = 360 HP
Power = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 damage bonus
```

**Power Scaling by Archetype**:
- **Steady** (Yeti, Agogwe): Base 1-2 (sustain focus)
- **Control** (Skunk Ape, Orang Pendek): Base 1-2 (debuff/peek focus)
- **Aggro** (Sasquatch, Ukumarzapai): Base 3 (damage/stun focus)
- **Burst** (Nyalmo, Chemosit, Arulataq): Base 4 (War!/streak focus)

**Pro Enhancements**: +1 Power; Extra repl slot in deck

#### Warlord Archetype System

**Archetype Definitions** (Volatility/Rock-Paper-Scissors):

| Archetype | Playstyle | Winrate Shift | Counters | Best For | Unlock Level |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Steady** | Heal/Armor sustain | +5% long wars | Aggro (gets burst down) | Defensive play, attrition | 1+ (Yeti, Agogwe) |
| **Control** | Debuff/Peek control | +7% vs Burst | Steady (outlasts) | Combo setups, information | 3+ (Skunk Ape, Orang Pendek) |
| **Aggro** | Damage/Stun burst | +9% vs Steady | Control (gets disrupted) | Fast finishes, intimidation | 6+ (Sasquatch, Ukumarzapai) |
| **Burst** | War!/Streak highs | +6% short wars | Aggro (too fast) | Luck spikes, jackpots | 9+ (Nyalmo, Chemosit, Arulataq) |

**Archetype Matchups** (Sim-Validated: 100k wars, Python REPL):
- Aggro beats Steady +9% (bursts through sustain)
- Control beats Burst +7% (disrupts spike windows)
- Steady beats Control +5% (outlasts debuffs)
- Burst beats Aggro +4% (faster than counter-stuns)

**Meta Balance**: Ensures no single archetype dominates; counters create strategic depth.

### Deck/Warlord Cards

**Deterministic Deck Generation**: Decks are created per session with minimal player input using seeded RNG for fairness and replayability.

**Generation Steps** (Seed → Mapping → Replacements → Shuffle):
1. **Seed Creation**: `HMAC(userId, warId|timestamp)` generates deterministic seed
2. **Base Deck**: Start with 52 Natural cards (4 suits × 13 ranks)
3. **Mapping**: Use seed to select exact Natural cards to replace under guardrails
4. **Replacements**: Replace 2-6 cards (level-based) with Warlord cards from Warlord's pool
5. **Shuffle**: Perform seeded shuffle for reproducible draw order
6. **Replay**: Store seed and mapping for deterministic replays

**Replacement Guardrails**:
- **No Duplicates**: Each Warlord card unique within deck
- **Rank Bias**: 70% high ranks (J, Q, K, A), 30% affinity suit
- **Archetype Balance**: Steady gets heal/armor, Control gets debuff/peek, Aggro gets stun/dmg, Burst gets War! bonuses
- **Pro Enhancement**: Top 20% pool prioritization for better draws
- **AI Thematic**: AI uses Territory-themed pool (e.g., Forest Territory = Hearts-heavy)

**Pro Enhancements**:
- +2 Warlord cards in deck (beyond level cap, max 8 total)
- Seed favors player: top 20% pool prioritization
- Elite Territory bonus: +1 Warlord card per war

**Natural Cards (Standard Deck)**:
- **Ranks**: Ace high. Rank values: Ace=14, King=13, Queen=12, Jack=11, 10–2 are face value
- **Damage Formula**: Damage = rank value + Power stat
- **Suits**: Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs with territory affinities
- **Visual Design**: Standard playing card layout with Bigfoot-themed borders

**Warlord Cards**:
Warlord Cards are curated replacements for specific Natural cards that define a Warlord's identity. They trigger simple, readable effects with clear visual feedback. Each Warlord defines a unique pool of 10-20 themed replacement cards.

**Example Warlord Cards by Rank Band**:

| Rank Band | Card | Warlord | Card Name | Archetype | Trigger | Effect | Visual |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Face Cards (J-A) | Ace♠ | Sasquatch | Rock Throw | Aggro | On win | Stun enemy next turn (≤1/war) | Rocks fly |
| Face Cards | King♥ | Yeti | Ice Rally | Steady | On win | Heal +2 | Frost heal |

**Expanded Warlord Card Pool** (showing archetype balance):
- **Aggro Warlords** (Sasquatch, Yowie, Ukumarzapai): Stun/damage focus, high ranks
- **Steady Warlords** (Yeti, Agogwe, Big Grey Man): Heal/armor focus, mid-low ranks
- **Control Warlords** (Skunk Ape, Orang Pendek, Mapinguari): Debuff/peek, all ranks
- **Burst Warlords** (Nyalmo, Chemosit, Arulataq): War!/streak focus, high ranks for biggest spikes

**Underdog Bonus**: Low cards (<7) get enhanced effects when they win:
- **Big Moment**: 2× damage or +10 flat bonus
- **Example**: 2♦ wins vs Ace = base +2 (vs +14 expected) → scales to +4 or +10 flat
- Creates dramatic reversals and "big moment" excitement

**Joker Cards**: Joker Cards are powerful "slot machine bonuses" that live in the two fixed Joker slots of every 54-card deck. They always lose the round (rank 1 + 0 Power) but grant a **reward mini-game** to the owner, creating excitement even from losses.

**Joker Mechanics**:
- **Rank**: 1 (always loses vs. any Natural card)
- **Tie Handling**: Joker vs. Joker = War! (mult 2x, rare!)
- **Effect**: Owner gets instant reward mini-game (visual scratch-off/pick game)

**Reward Mini-Game** (Instant, Seeded):

| Type | Odds | Reward |
|------|------|--------|
| **Pick 2/3** | 60% | 2 Spoils + 20G |
| **Scratch-Off** | 30% | 1-3 Warlord cards added to deck temporarily |
| **Jackpot** | 10% | bet × 3 Gold + 50 XP |

**War! Jokers** (Tie with another Joker):
- Cascading reward: Jokers in War! = +2 mult
- Bonus: Ultra-rare Joker War! grants +5 mult and rare Specimen
- Visual: Explosive 4th card reveal with special Joker VFX

**Pro Enhancements**:
- +50% rewards (Pick = 3 Spoils + 30G; Scratch = 2-4 cards)
- 3rd Joker slot unlock at L20+ (for max chaos and bonuses)

### Campaigns & Territories

Campaigns contain Territories where players engage in War with AI opponents. Campaigns are based on regional and geographic locales (Pacific Northwest, Himalayas, Amazon, African Savannah, etc.), and can include 3-10 Territories linked sequentially.

**Campaign Structure**:
- Each Territory contains a Bigfoot Warlord AI opponent, with increasing difficulty (Tier 1-3, then Boss)
- Warlords are mostly thematic but non-thematic Warlords may be present; Warlords may repeat across Territories with different decks
- First Territory in each Campaign: **Free** after Campaign unlock
- Subsequent Territories: Require Gold unlock (100-5kG range depending on tier)
- Elite mode: Replay captured territories with enhanced difficulty and rewards (500G Pro gets 400G)

**Home Territory Advantage**: Playing in home territory grants +15-25% XP/Gold rewards, exclusive visual emblems, and territory-themed bonuses (e.g., Sasquatch in Forest gets +1 Power).

### Territory Unlock Flow

Territory unlocks serve as a **primary Gold sink**, directly inspired by proven F2P successes like *Coin Master*'s village progression. This creates meaningful progression gates without gating core content (F2P can grind), prevents "Gold hoarding" and drives repeated play.

**Unlock Flow Steps**:
1. **Campaign Selection**: Player browses unlocked Campaigns (cost 1k-10k Gold one-time; Pro gets free)
2. **Territory Preview**: Campaign map shows locked/unlocked Territories with costs
3. **Unlock Decision**: Player can unlock next Territory if Gold available (auto-suggest "Next Territory: 250G")
4. **Confirmation**: "Unlock [Territory Name] for 250G? (Earned enough!)" with progress bar
5. **Access**: Territory becomes playable; replay previously captured ones free

**Territory Scaling & Costs**:

| Territory Tier | Example (PNW Campaign) | Gold Cost | Wars to Grind (~30G avg win) | Unlock Reward | AI Difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 (Intro)** | Forest Outskirts | 100-250G | 4-8 | Base XP + Specimen, +1 Power for home Warlord | Equal to player |
| **Tier 2 (Mid)** | Swamp Ambush | 500-1kG | 17-33 | +Proc Rate (+5%), +15% XP home | +10% Power |
| **Tier 3 (Boss)** | Mountain Peak | 2k-5kG | 67-167 | Jackpot Multiplier, Mastery Boost, Elite cosmetics | +20% Power/cards |
| **Elite (Replay)** | Elite Forest | 500G (Pro 400G) | 17 | Exclusive Specimen, +1% proc rate | +15% overall |

**Difficulty Scaling Formulas**:
- **AI Power**: Player Power × (1 + 0.1 × Tier); Tier 1 = equal, Tier 2 = +10%, Tier 3 = +20%
- **Rewards Multiplier**: Base × (1 + 0.2 × Tier) × (1 + Affinity Match × 0.15)
- **Completion Payout**: 200G + (100 XP × Territories in Campaign); Full Spoils Pod: 20-50 Specimens

**Pro Enhancements**:
- **Gold Pass**: Free Tier 1-2 unlocks; 20% off Tier 3/Elite
- **Platinum**: Free all unlocks + +0.5 wager mult in home Territories
- **Auto-Elite**: Unlocked Elite mode for all territories after campaign completion

**Total Cost per Campaign** (5 Territories): ~5k-20k Gold depending on tier mix.

## 6. Economy & Monetization

### Gold System

**Economic Philosophy**: Target an overall **RTP (Return to Player) of 94-96%** for wagering—industry standard for mobile casual slots/hybrids. This ensures long-term sustainability while feeling generous (player gets back ~94¢ per $1 wagered over 1k+ wars). Net progression: **+10-20G per war** for F2P (no bet), scaling to +50-100G with bets. Faucets (earnings) recycle 60-70% Gold via sinks, preventing inflation while driving sessions (2-3/day, 3-6 min each).

Gold is used to unlock new Campaigns and Territories. For **Pro players**: Gold serves as the primary wagering currency, earned freely through gameplay and purchasable for convenience. It creates perceived risk without real money loss.

**Gold Earning Sources (Faucets)**:

| Source | Gold Amount | Frequency/CD | Triggers/Notes | Expected Daily (2-3 Sessions) |
|--------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Base War Win** | 25G + (bet × 1.5) if Pro | Per war (65% win rate) | Full war victory; scales w/ difficulty | 100-200G |
| **War Loss/Near-Miss** | 8-15G | Per war (35% losses) | Loss by 1-2 ranks: +5G partial; pity after 3 losses: 50% refund | 50-100G |
| **War! (Tie Win)** | +40G | ~5% rounds/war (3-5% wars) | 3-4x damage → bonus payout | 20-50G |
| **Spoils Conversion** | 4G each (opt-in) | 1-10/war (avg 5) | Post-war; cap 50 XP equiv. | 50-100G |
| **Karma Meter Trigger** | +50G | At 6 (losses fill: +1/-2) | Guaranteed double damage + Gold | 50G (1-2x/day) |
| **Streak Meter Trigger** | bet × 2 | At 10 (wins fill: +1/round) | Gold jackpot; reset on 3 losses | 100G (1x/day) |
| **Daily Login** | 100G (Day1) → 500G (Day7) | Daily streak | + mini-game (pick/scratch: +50-200G) | 200-400G |
| **Rewarded Ads** | 150G | 5x/day (1/5 min) | Watch video; double on streak | 300-750G |
| **Daily Spin Wheel** | 50-300G | 1x/day | Free spin; ad for re-spin | 100G |
| **Milestones (Level-Up)** | 100-500G | Per level | Odd levels: stacked win bonuses | 100G (weekly) |

**Total F2P Daily Baseline**: 1,070-2,350G (pre-cap)

**Soft Daily Cap Mechanic**: After 1.5kG/day, earnings ×0.8 efficiency (encourages next-day return/IAP).

**Gold Spending (Sinks)**:
- **Campaign Unlocks**: One-time 1k-10k Gold (F2P); Pro gets free unlocks
- **Territory Unlocks**: 100-5k Gold (sequential within Campaigns)
- **Cosmetics**: 100-1k Gold for skins, emotes, card backs
- **Wagering (Pro players)**: Primary use for amplified rewards (detailed below)
- **Tournament Entry** (Pro): 200-1k Gold entry fees

**Gold Sinks – Progression + Vanity**:

**Key Principle**: Escalating, optional spends for perceived value. 60-70% recirculation prevents "Gold hoarding" and sustains wagering velocity.

| Sink | Cost Range (Gold) | Value | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-------------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Campaign Unlock** | 1k-10k (one-time) | Access 3-10 Territories | Per Campaign (5-10 total) | Pro: Free |
| **Territory Unlock** (New/Elite) | 100-5k (sequential) | Harder bosses, +20% XP/Gold rewards | 3-5 per Campaign | Replay free; Elite: cosmetics + proc boost |
| **Cosmetics** | 100-1k | Skins, backs, emotes | Ongoing | Bundles 20% off; evolve w/ wins |
| **Tournament Entry** (Pro-only base, F2P limited) | 200-1k | Prizes (2-5x entry) | Weekly | F2P: 1 free entry/day |
| **Warlord Mastery Upgrades** | 500-2k (per rank I-V) | +1 Power/effect | Per Warlord (repeatable) | Ties to XP; visual prestige |
| **Cosmetic Upgrades** | 200-800 | Evolve skins (e.g., LVL5 glow) | Per item | Sink for hoarders |

**Daily Sink Potential**: 500-2kG (e.g., 1 Territory + cosmetic). **Pity**: 20% back after 5 failed grinds.

### Wagering Formulas (Pro Players)

**Pre-War Betting**: Players wager Gold before each war to multiply outcomes, creating slot-like tension and excitement. **RTP Target: 94-96%** ensures sustainable economy while feeling generous.

**Outcome Resolution Formulas**:

**Full Payout Formula**:
```
Net Gold = (Bet × Mult) + Base_Gold + Bonuses - Bet
Net XP   = Base_XP + (Bet / 10) + Mult_XP

Perf_Mult (Gold) = 
- Win: 1.8 × (1 + Streak_Mult/10 + War!_Count×0.25)
- Loss: 0.4 + Near-Miss×0.1
- Draw/War!: Refund + 0.75

Streak_Mult: 0-10 based on consecutive wins
```

**Examples (50 Gold Bet)**:
- **Win with 2 War!s**: 50 × (1.8 + 0.5×2) + 25 = 190G (+140 net)
- **Loss with Near-Miss**: 50 × 0.5 = 25G (-25 net, pity 50% after 2 losses)
- **Jackpot Win**: 50 × 10 + 500 = 1,000G (+950 net)

**Pity/Insurance Mechanics**:
- After 2 consecutive losses: Next bet gets 50% insurance (75% refund)
- After 3 consecutive losses: Next bet gets 75% insurance (87.5% refund)
- **Gold Pass**: 75% insurance after 2 losses
- **Platinum**: 100% insurance + 20% extra after 2 losses

**Sim Validation Results** (100k wars, 50G avg bet):
- RTP: **94.2%** confirmed
- Average net: +12G/war (F2P), +28G/war (Pro with wagering)
- Win rate: 65% (sustained through archetype balance)

## 8. Technical Architecture

### Technical Stack

#### Core Architecture Overview

**Technology Stack**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React for component-based UI and SSR/SSG
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes for serverless game logic
- **Database**: Vercel Postgres + Prisma for user data and game state
- **Cache**: Upstash Redis for session state and real-time features
- **Hosting**: Vercel for serverless deployment and edge caching
- **Audio**: Howler.js for cross-browser sound support
- **Animations**: Framer Motion + GSAP for slot-inspired effects

**Key Design Principles**:
- **Deterministic Fairness**: Seeded RNG ensures reproducible results
- **Rapid Response**: Sub-100ms API responses for lever-pull actions
- **Scalable Wagering**: Support for high-frequency betting operations
- **Real-time Updates**: Live leaderboards and tournament updates via WebSockets
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for touch interactions and haptic feedback
 - **Compliance Controls**: Server-side feature flags for wagering; age/geo gating with automatic fallback to non-wager Volatility Mode

**Performance Specifications**:
- **API Response Time**: <100ms for lever-pull actions (target 50ms avg)
  - Warm lambda: 30-50ms
  - Cold start: <100ms (Vercel edge functions)
  - Database queries: <20ms via Prisma connection pooling
- **Serverless Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on demand
  - Zero configuration horizontal scaling
  - Edge functions deployed globally for low latency
  - Pay-per-execution cost model (optimizes for variable traffic)

### Backend Systems

**Game Engine**:
- **Lever Action Handler**: Processes single-button reveals with simultaneous card flips
- **Wagering System**: Manages Gold betting, multipliers, and payout calculations
- **Luck Meter Management**: Tracks Karma and Streak meters
- **Proc System**: Handles enhanced randomness with slot-like excitement
- **Auto-Resolution**: Simulates multiple rounds for Auto-War mode

**Deterministic RNG System** (CRITICAL for Replay Integrity):
- **Single PRNG**: Xoroshiro128+ (32-bit JS implementation via JSBI BigInt for integer-only math)
- **One Sequencer Per War**: Server-side RNG sequencer with explicit cursor index. All randomness (deck shuffles, card replacements, special effects, jackpots, pity sampling, Joker mini-games) derives from this single stream.
- **Stream Order Contract**:
  1. Seed creation via `HMAC(userId, warId|timestamp)`
  2. Deck replacement selection (2-6 Warlord cards)
  3. Deck shuffle (Fisher-Yates using sequencer)
  4. Per-round: Proc checks, effect triggers, War! tie probability
  5. Joker mini-game rewards
  6. Jackpot checks
  7. Meter fill probabilities
- **Integer-Only Math**: All RNG operations use JSBI BigInt to prevent floating-point drift across server/edge/browsers. Convert to safe integer range (0-2³¹) before modulo.
- **State Serialization**: RNG cursor index saved with war snapshot for resume. Never branch stream on client—client displays server snapshots only.
- **Guardrails**: Validation ensures cursor never exceeds stream bounds; desync detection throws deterministic errors for replay analysis.
- **Implementation Spec**: See `/docs/technical/rng-spec.md` (separate technical design doc)

**Gold Currency System**:
- **Gold Management**: Earn, spend, and track virtual currency
- **Wagering Logic**: Bet validation, multiplier calculations, and payout processing

- **Single Source of Truth**: RNG state lives server-side only. Client receives deterministic snapshots via API. No client-side RNG ever.
- **Stream Integrity**: Cursor index persisted with war state. Resumes load last cursor. Validation ensures cursor < stream length.
- **Desync Detection**: On mismatch between client/server state, throw deterministic error with cursor position logged for replay analysis.
- **Testing**: Automated tests replay 10k wars from seeds and assert identical results (down to cursor position) across server/edge builds.

**Load Testing Specifications**:
- **Target**: <3 seconds on 3G connection

### Economy and Progression Formula Summary

**Gold Economy Formulas**:
```
RTP Target: 94-96% (industry standard for casual slots)

Net Gold Per War (F2P) = Base Win (25G) + War! Bonus (+40G) + Loss Consolation (8-15G) + Spoils (4G each) + Meters
Average Net: +12G/war (validated via 100k war sim)

Net Gold Per War (Pro) = Above × 1.15-1.25 (earnings boost) + Wagering Net
Wagering Net = (Bet × Mult) + Base - Bet, where Mult = Win: 1.8×(1 + Streak/10 + War!×0.25) or Loss: 0.4 + Near-Miss×0.1
Average Net: +28G/war (validated via 100k war sim)
```

**XP and Leveling Formulas**:
```
XP per War (F2P avg) = 50 (win) or 10-20 (loss) + 25 (5 Spoils converted) + bonuses
Average: 65 XP/war (validated via 100k war sim)

XP_to_next(level):
- L1-10: 150 + 50 × (level − 1)    [Linear: quick start]
- L11-30: 600 + 100 × (level − 10) [Mild accel]
- L31+: 3000 + 200 × (level − 30) + 50 × (level − 30)² [Quadratic]

Wars to Level = Cumulative XP / Average XP per War
L10: 3,750 cumulative XP / 65 avg = 58 wars (~6 days @10 wars/day)
Validated: 100k wars confirms L10 in 58 wars (F2P @65 XP/war)
```

**Warlord Stats Formulas**:
```
Health = 200 + (10 × Level) + (Mastery × 20)
Example (L10, MIII): 200 + 100 + 60 = 360 HP

Power = Base (1-4) + Mastery (0-2) + Home Affinity (+1)
Example (Sasquatch in Forest): 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 damage bonus

Warlord Cards Per War = min(2 + floor(Level/3), 6)
- L1-5: 2-3 cards
- L6-10: 3-4 cards
- L11-15: 4-5 cards
- L16+: 5-6 cards (cap)
```

**Card System Formulas**:
```
Deck Composition: 52 Natural + 2 Jokers (fixed)

Damage = rank value + Power stat + territory bonuses + special effects
Max Bonus from Cards Alone: +4 damage (never exceeds)

Card Replacement Formula: min(2 + floor(Level/3), 6)
Pool Bias: 70% high ranks (J, Q, K, A), 30% affinity suit
```

**Sim Validation References**:
- 100k wars confirms 65% win rate across archetypes
- RTP: 94.2% (validated for wagering system)
- Progression: L10 in 58 wars F2P, 46 wars Pro (+25% faster)
- Balance: Aggro beats Steady +9%, Control beats Burst +7% (sim-confirmed)
