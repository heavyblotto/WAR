#### **Content Budget Guidelines**

**Warlord Cards (Playable)**:
- **Per Warlord**: 8 unique cards
  - 2 Evergreen signatures (always present)
  - 6 Set‑unique across 3 Signature Sets (≈2 per set; 2–4 active per war as progression allows)
- **Total**: 80 unique across 10 playables

**Warlord Cards (AI‑only)**:
- **Reuse‑first**: 1 new identity special per AI; 1–2 borrowed from playable pool
- **Total new**: ~12 (for 16 AI), with heavy reuse to reduce scope

**Relics**:
- **Territory Relics**: 4 base (Forest, Mountain, Swamp, Jungle)
- **Boss Mk II**: 4 (one per territory)
- **Global**: 8–10 universal 1‑liners
- **Total**: 16–18 unique

**Rationale & Guardrails**:
- **Late‑game Cap**: 6 Warlord Cards per war satisfied by 2 Evergreen + 2–4 Set cards
- **Rank Band Spread**: Face×2, High(10–7)×3, Mid(6–4)×2, Low(3–2)×1 per Warlord
- **Suit Spread**: Primary territory suit within base±1; no suit below base−1
- **Effect Caps**: Stun/Skip ≤1 avg; Debuff −1 resolves once; small Armor/Heal (+1…+2)

#### **Authoring Patterns & Formulas**

**High-level Taxonomy**:
- **Triggers**: on reveal; on win; on loss; on tie start/end; on War! win; on next draw; first time per war/reshuffle
- **Effects**: flat damage adders; rank shifts (+1 next draw / −1 enemy next); armor/heal (+1…+2); peek/reveal; skip/stun (≤1 avg/war)
- **Guardrails**: per‑war/per‑reshuffle caps; resolve‑once flags; no stacking −1 rank; no raw multipliers
- **Flavor Mapping**: Hearts=heal; Spades=armor; Diamonds=−1 enemy next rank; Clubs=+1 next‑draw rank

**Warlord Card Patterns**:
- **On‑Win Utility**:
  - Hearts: heal +1 (Face/High); +2 only on signature Face card
  - Spades: +1 armor (persists 1 hit)
  - Clubs: +1 next‑draw rank
  - Diamonds: enemy next −1 rank (resolve once)
- **On‑Reveal One‑Shot**: enemy next −1 rank (resolve once); peek enemy next suit
- **Tie/War! Interactions**: if previous round tied: on win, +2 damage; on War! win: gain +1 armor
- **State‑based**: if you have armor: on win, heal +1

**Suggested Numeric Knobs**:
- **Bonus Damage**: +2 to +4 for mid‑band utilities (never >+4 from cards)
- **Heal/Armor**: +1 baseline; +2 only on signatures or Hearts/Spades Face
- **Rank Shifts**: always ±1
- **Meter Nudges**: Fortune +1, Epic +1 (≤1/war/card id)

**Band Defaults (Speed Authoring)**:
- **2–3**: if win → choose one of {+8 damage, heal +2, +2 armor}; if loss → Fortune +2 and +1 next‑draw rank
- **6–8**: pick exactly one utility; no loss effect
- **9–10**: 30% chance +2 chip utility; else nothing
- **Face**: one standout (stun/skip) and one sustain/control; minimal adders elsewhere
