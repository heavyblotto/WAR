**Game Loop and Game Rules**

#### **Core Game Loop (Step-by-Step)**

**Phase 1: Pre-War Setup**
1. **Mode Selection**: Player chooses Practice Mode (new players) or Normal Mode (experienced players)
2. **Warlord Selection**: Player browses carousel of available Bigfoot Warlords (Sasquatch, Yeti, Mapinguary, Agogwe, etc.), each with unique visual themes, signature abilities, and volatility preferences
3. **Territory Choice**: Player selects one of four territories (Forest/Hearts, Mountain/Spades, Swamp/Diamonds, Jungle/Clubs) and difficulty tier (I/II/III)
4. **Signature Set Management**: Player views active Signature Set (2-3 themed cards) and can reroll once per war (free) or additional times (VIP)
5. **Wagering Decision**: Player chooses bet amount (Low: 10 Gold/1.5x, Medium: 50 Gold/2x, High: 200 Gold/3-5x, All-In: 1000+ Gold/10x) and volatility mode (Steady/Wild) - Practice Mode uses Practice Gold with no real risk
6. **AI Opponent Assignment**: System selects appropriate AI Warlord based on territory tier and player level

**Phase 2: War Initialization**

7. **Deck Generation**: System creates 54-card deck (52 Natural cards + 2 Relic slots) with Warlord cards replacing specific Natural cards under guardrails
8. **Seed Creation**: Deterministic seed generated from secure inputs (HMAC(userId, warId|timestamp)) for reproducible results
9. **Deck Shuffle**: Seeded shuffle ensures consistent draw order for replays
10. **Initial State**: Both players start with full health, empty meters, and shuffled decks
11. **War Board Display**: Game transitions to main gameplay screen with territory-themed background

**Phase 3: Core War Loop**

12. **Lever Pull**: Player presses "Pull Lever" button (primary action) triggering simultaneous card reveals
13. **Card Reveal**: Both player and AI cards flip simultaneously (280-320ms spring animation) with territory-themed effects
14. **Rank Comparison**: System compares card ranks (Ace=14, King=13, Queen=12, Jack=11, 10-2 face value) plus Power stat bonuses
15. **Damage Calculation**: Winner deals damage = rank value + Power stat + territory bonuses + special effects
16. **Special Effects**: Triggered effects resolve (heal, armor, debuffs, rank shifts, peeks, stuns, skips) with visual feedback
17. **Meter Updates**: Fortune Meter (+1 on loss, +2 on War! loss), Epic Meter (+1 per Spoils), Wager Streak Meter (+1 per Gold wagered)
18. **Health Updates**: Damage applied to loser's health bar with segmented tick marks and territory-themed animations

**Phase 4: War! Resolution (Tie Handling)**

19. **Tie Detection**: When both cards have same rank, War! sequence triggers
20. **War! Animation**: Three face-down cards stack rapidly (80ms each) + explosive 4th card reveal with marquee lights and siren sounds
21. **War! Damage**: Winner deals 3-4x damage (territory-dependent) with enhanced visual effects
22. **War! Effects**: Special War!-triggered effects activate (bonus damage, armor, peeks, etc.)
23. **Card Disposal**: All War! cards go to respective discard piles (no capture)

**Phase 5: Round Completion**

24. **Proc System**: Random special effects trigger (15-25% base rate, +5-15% with higher bets)
25. **Near-Miss Detection**: Loss by 1-2 ranks triggers partial payout (0.5x bet) + Fortune Meter boost
26. **Jackpot Check**: Deterministic combos (matching suits + War! win) + 1% random chance for jackpot
27. **Meter Triggers**: Check if Fortune (6), Epic (full), or Wager Streak (20) meters trigger bonuses
28. **Relic Activation**: Active Relics trigger based on their conditions (next win, next loss, on reveal, per round, per Spoils, etc.) - Relics are NOT drawn as cards but exist as persistent slot bonuses

**Phase 6: War Continuation Decision**

29. **Health Check**: If either player's health reaches 0, war ends
30. **Deck Check**: If either deck empties, reshuffle occurs with suit pity timer (surface territory suit cards)
31. **Continue Loop**: If both players alive and cards available, return to Phase 3
32. **Nudge Option**: Player can spend 20 Gold to adjust card rank ±1 (once per war, cannot turn loss to win)

**Phase 7: War Conclusion**

33. **Victory Determination**: Player wins if AI health reaches 0, loses if player health reaches 0
34. **Gold Payout**: Calculate Gold won = (bet × multiplier) + base rewards + bonuses - Gold wagered (Practice Mode: Practice Gold only)
35. **XP Calculation**: Base XP (50) + difficulty bonus (Tier II: +25, Tier III: +50) + wagering bonus (+1 XP per 10 Gold wagered)
36. **Spoils Generation**: Spoils earned based on performance (1-10 Spoils per war)
37. **Progression Updates**: Update level XP, Warlord Mastery XP, Territory Stank XP, VIP points

**Phase 8: Post-War Results**

38. **Results Screen**: Display verdict banner with territory-themed VFX (confetti/leaf/ice/swamp/jungle)
39. **Spoils Conversion**: Animated bar converting Spoils to XP (up to 50 XP cap) + bonus rolls (1 per 5 Spoils)
40. **Bonus Roll Animation**: Slot-style reel animation (3 columns) with rarity color pulses and duplicate conversion to shards
41. **Specimen Collection**: New Specimens collected with "new" badges and collection summary
42. **Gold Summary**: Net Gold result with wagering efficiency and pity protection usage (Practice Mode: Practice Gold only)
43. **Progression Display**: Territory Stank bar increase, Warlord Mastery progress, level progress, VIP point accumulation

**Phase 9: Post-War Decisions**

44. **Rematch Options**: 
    - "Rematch (same seed)" - exact replay with repetition decay warnings
    - "Rematch (new seed)" - fresh shuffle with new RNG
45. **Navigation Options**:
    - Return to Lobby for new war setup

#### **Detailed Game Rules**

- **Relic Cards**: Occupy Joker slots with powerful one-sentence effects
- **Suit Themes**: Hearts (healing), Spades (armor), Diamonds (debuffs), Clubs (momentum)

**Relic Card Mechanics (Critical Clarification)**

- **Activation Triggers**: Relics activate based on specific trigger windows (next win, next loss, on reveal, per round, per Spoils, etc.)

- **Persistent Effects**: Some Relics (Fortune Charm, Epic Catalyst) provide ongoing benefits without being consumed
- **Late-Game Relics**: Additional Relics (up to 2 extra) may replace mid-band Natural cards under guardrails

#### **Content Budget Guidelines**

**Warlord Cards (Playable)**:
- **Per Warlord**: 8 unique cards
  - 2 Evergreen signatures (always present)
  - 6 Set‑unique across 3 Signature Sets (≈2 per set; 2–4 active per war as progression allows)
- **Total**: 80 unique across 10 playables

**Warlord Cards (AI‑only)**:
- **Reuse‑first**: 1 new identity special per AI; 1–2 borrowed from playable pool
- **Total new**: ~12 (for 16 AI), with heavy reuse to reduce scope

**Relics**:
- **Territory Relics**: 4 base (Forest, Mountain, Swamp, Jungle)
- **Boss Mk II**: 4 (one per territory)
- **Global**: 8–10 universal 1‑liners
- **Total**: 16–18 unique

**Rationale & Guardrails**:
- **Late‑game Cap**: 6 Warlord Cards per war satisfied by 2 Evergreen + 2–4 Set cards
- **Rank Band Spread**: Face×2, High(10–7)×3, Mid(6–4)×2, Low(3–2)×1 per Warlord
- **Suit Spread**: Primary territory suit within base±1; no suit below base−1
- **Effect Caps**: Stun/Skip ≤1 avg; Debuff −1 resolves once; small Armor/Heal (+1…+2)

#### **Authoring Patterns & Formulas**

**High-level Taxonomy**:
- **Triggers**: on reveal; on win; on loss; on tie start/end; on War! win; on next draw; first time per war/reshuffle
- **Effects**: flat damage adders; rank shifts (+1 next draw / −1 enemy next); armor/heal (+1…+2); peek/reveal; skip/stun (≤1 avg/war)
- **Guardrails**: per‑war/per‑reshuffle caps; resolve‑once flags; no stacking −1 rank; no raw multipliers
- **Flavor Mapping**: Hearts=heal; Spades=armor; Diamonds=−1 enemy next rank; Clubs=+1 next‑draw rank

**Warlord Card Patterns**:
- **On‑Win Utility**:
  - Hearts: heal +1 (Face/High); +2 only on signature Face card
  - Spades: +1 armor (persists 1 hit)
  - Clubs: +1 next‑draw rank
  - Diamonds: enemy next −1 rank (resolve once)
- **On‑Reveal One‑Shot**: enemy next −1 rank (resolve once); peek enemy next suit
- **Tie/War! Interactions**: if previous round tied: on win, +2 damage; on War! win: gain +1 armor
- **State‑based**: if you have armor: on win, heal +1

**Suggested Numeric Knobs**:
- **Bonus Damage**: +2 to +4 for mid‑band utilities (never >+4 from cards)
- **Heal/Armor**: +1 baseline; +2 only on signatures or Hearts/Spades Face
- **Rank Shifts**: always ±1
- **Meter Nudges**: Fortune +1, Epic +1 (≤1/war/card id)

**Band Defaults (Speed Authoring)**:
- **2–3**: if win → choose one of {+8 damage, heal +2, +2 armor}; if loss → Fortune +2 and +1 next‑draw rank
- **6–8**: pick exactly one utility; no loss effect
- **9–10**: 30% chance +2 chip utility; else nothing
- **Face**: one standout (stun/skip) and one sustain/control; minimal adders elsewhere
