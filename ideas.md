# Bigfoot War - Game Design Ideas

## Core Concept
A Next.js card game based on the classic game War, featuring Bigfoot creatures from around the world. Players battle using card mechanics with additional combat systems, creating a slot machine-like experience with strategic depth.

## Game Mechanics

### Basic Gameplay Loop
1. **Card Draw**: Both players draw simultaneously
2. **Winner Selection**: Higher card wins automatically
3. **Decision Phase**: Winner chooses "Grab" (collect cards) or "Smash" (attack)
4. **Smash Mechanics**: Timing-based mini-game for damage multipliers
   - Perfect timing = 1.5x damage
   - Good timing = 1.0x damage
   - Miss = 0.5x damage
5. **Damage Resolution**: Apply suit-based effects and status conditions
6. **Win Conditions**: Collect all cards OR reduce opponent health to 0

### Card Suit Attack System
- ♠️ **Spades**: Dark/Poison (damage over time)
- ♥️ **Hearts**: Life/Heal (restore HP + shield)
- ♦️ **Diamonds**: Earth/Physical (high burst damage)
- ♣️ **Clubs**: Nature/Stun (disable + moderate damage)

### Face Card Special Abilities
- **Jacks (11)**: "Quick Strike" - Attack twice this turn
- **Queens (12)**: "Royal Command" - Choose your next card suit
- **Kings (13)**: "Devastating Blow" - Ignore all defense
- **Aces (14)**: "Wild Card" - Copy the last ability used

## Bigfoot Types & Stats

### MVP Strategy - Single Player vs AI
**Starting Roster**: Player begins with **Sasquatch** (balanced starter)
**AI Opponents**: All 57 Bigfoots available as AI opponents from day one
**Progression**: Defeat AI Bigfoots to unlock them as playable characters

### Starter Bigfoot
- **Sasquatch**: 100 HP, 1.2x Attack, 2 Defense (Classic Bigfoot, balanced stats)

### Unlock Progression Tiers
**Tier 1 (Levels 1-5)**: Dwarf Types (12 creatures)
- Easier opponents, lower HP, unique abilities
- Examples: Agogwe, Hibagon, Barbegazi

**Tier 2 (Levels 6-15)**: Squatch Types (34 creatures) 
- Balanced opponents, varied strategies
- Examples: Yeti, Skunk Ape, Yowie, Momo

**Tier 3 (Levels 16-25)**: Giant Types (11 creatures)
- Challenging opponents, high HP, powerful attacks
- Examples: Genoskwa, Nyalmo, Dzu-Teh

### Boss Battle System
- **Weekly Boss**: Rotate through all 57 Bigfoots as special boss encounters
- **Boss Rush Mode**: Fight sequence of increasingly difficult AI opponents
- **Survival Mode**: How many AI Bigfoots can you defeat in a row?

### Stat Formula
```
Bigfoot Health = Base HP + (Level × 10)
Attack Damage = (Card Value × Attack Multiplier) + Suit Bonus
Defense = Flat damage reduction per hit
```

## Rage Meter System
- **Building Rage**: Take damage (+10 per 10 HP), perfect timing (+5), opponent heals (+15)
- **Rage Abilities** (at 100 rage):
  - **Sasquatch**: "Primal Fury" - Next 3 attacks deal double damage
  - **Yeti**: "Avalanche" - AoE attack hits all enemy status effects
  - **Skunk Ape**: "Toxic Cloud" - All attacks poison for 5 turns

## Arena System
Dynamic environments that affect gameplay:
- **Forest Clearing** (Starter): Neutral effects
- **Frozen Peaks** (Level 5): +10% Ice damage, -5% Fire damage
- **Toxic Swamp** (Level 10): All poison effects last +1 turn
- **Volcanic Crater** (Level 15): +15% Fire damage, screen shake effects
- **Ancient Ruins** (Level 20): Face cards get +20% damage bonus

## Progression & Economy

### Gold Economy (Slot Machine Psychology)
- **Casual Matches**: Free entry, 50-100g reward
- **Ranked Matches**: 25g entry, 150g winner pot
- **Tournament Brackets**: 100g entry, 800g winner pot
- **Boss Battles**: 50g entry, rare rewards + 300g

### Gold Spending Options

- **Arena Access** (200g): Early unlock battlegrounds
- **Bigfoot Skins** (300-1000g): Visual customization
- **Booster Items** (50g): Temporary match buffs

### XP System (10-25 per win)
- **Stat Points**: +2 HP, +0.1 Attack, +1 Defense per level
- **Ability Unlocks**: New face card powers
- **Arena Access**: Higher level = cooler battlegrounds
- **Prestige Ranks**: Bronze/Silver/Gold borders

### Progression Path

```

## Meta Game Features

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Storage**: Local storage for progression (MVP)

### Network Play Considerations
- **Design**: Async-first with 30-second timers
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live matches
- **Anti-cheat**: Server validates all moves
- **Reconnection**: Handle dropped connections gracefully

## NFT Considerations (Future)

### Hybrid Model Approach
- Cards start as regular game assets
- Players can mint special cards as NFTs after achievements
- Keep core gameplay fast and accessible
- NFT layer for rare/legendary cards only

### Challenges Identified
- Gas fees too high for casual gameplay
- User friction with wallet connections
- Transaction speed incompatible with real-time play
- Most players want to play, not manage crypto

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Game Logic
- Basic War mechanics with Smash/Grab
- Card suit attack system
- Simple AI opponent

### Phase 2: Combat & Stats
- Bigfoot stats and abilities
- Rage meter implementation
- Status effects system

### Phase 3: UI/UX & Polish
- Timing mini-game interface
- Arena visuals and animations
- Sound effects and feedback

### Phase 4: Progression System
- Gold/XP economy
- Quest system
- Tournament modes

## Retention & Monetization Strategy

### Retention Hooks
- Daily login bonuses (gold multipliers)
- Weekly rotating "featured" Bigfoot with stat bonuses
- Seasonal events with limited-time rewards
- Achievement system with cosmetic unlocks

### Future Monetization (Cosmetic Only)
- Premium Battle Pass
- Arena themes/music packs
- Animated card backs
- **Never** pay-to-win mechanics

## Key Design Principles
1. **Slot Machine Feel**: Abundant gold rewards, quick dopamine hits
2. **Skill Expression**: Timing mini-games prevent pure RNG
3. **Strategic Depth**: Smash vs Grab decisions matter
4. **Accessible Core**: 3-minute matches, easy to learn
5. **Rich Progression**: Always something to work toward
